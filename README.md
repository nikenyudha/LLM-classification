# ðŸ§  LLM Preference Classification

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project is based on the **Kaggle competition: LLM - Detecting Human Preferences**.  
The task is to predict which responses users will prefer in a **head-to-head battle** between chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs).  

You'll be given a dataset of conversations from the **Chatbot Arena**, where multiple LLMs generate answers to user prompts. The challenge is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately identify the response that aligns better with human preferences.

By building a winning solution, we can contribute to improving chatbot alignment and ensure AI systems interact with humans in more helpful and meaningful ways.
